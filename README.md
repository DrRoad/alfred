An R-package for obtaining real-time data from ALFRED database

## ToDo
1) Choosing vintage begin and end.
2) Apply different versions, HOUST1, 2, 3, 4, so you also get first releases only.

## Not so nice right now
1) For series with lots of vintages and high release cycle (i.e. NFCI), code is slow because of multiple joins.
